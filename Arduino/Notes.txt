1. Battery reading - read straight from Arduino shield
2. Audio reading - Filtered and digitised value from from the radio output used to listen to the ELT signal. Gets fed into the Arduino shield with DSP circuits.
3. Strength - Signal reading from the Homer when in receive mode. In this mode, the homer reads a signal from just one of its two antennae and reports the intensity.
4. Direction - Signal reading from the Homer when in direction(differential?) mode. In this mode, the homer reads a signal from both antennae and reports the value as a left/right reading.
		* 0 is hard left, 512 is centre, 1023 is hard right.
